KPI:
1.Average amount = AVERAGE(Transction[TransactionAmount])

2.Number of customer = DISTINCTCOUNT(Transction[CardholderID])

3.Transction amount = SUM(Transction[TransactionAmount])

4.Transction count = COUNTROWS(Transction)

5.Transction frequency = DIVIDE([Transction count],[Number of customer],0)

6.Utilization rate for ATMs refer to the percentage of time that an ATM is being used for transction,as compared to the total time that the ATM is available for use.

Utilization rate=(Total Transction Time/Total available Tima)*100%


Utilization rate = 
var transction_time=SUM(Transction[Duration])
var available_time=24*365*60*SUM(Location[No of ATMs])
var utilization_rate=DIVIDE(transction_time,available_time,0)
return utilization_rate

7.Average Duration = AVERAGE(Transction[Duration])
